			<center><p>Firstly, at the above, that is my parents, Mr Sabri bin Hassan and her wife Mrs Hamisah binti Abd Sani. They get married in 1993. After 2 years of marriage their happiness has led to them being blessed with a daughter named Nurliyana, my first sister. The planning they did was very successful because we all had the same age of two years. After Nurliyana was born two years later, they also gave birth to a daughter, Nursabrina, which continued until the sixth child. But for their last child, my little brother, he had a distance of four years with my sixth sister
Our lives are entirely owned by Mr. Sabri. My dad was just a crane driver and my mother was a full-time housewife. So our siblings were all taken care of by our mother and never cared for by any nanny and all that. </p></center>
			<center><p>In 200, my first sister Nurliyana was determined to establish a home so that year she continued to marry and after a year she provided a responsible daughter-in-law to both of my parents, a man who loved my sister wholeheartedly. Jamirulhafiz bin Jamil. 
Below is the latest picture of our big family in the 2020 general election. This year as we know it in the wake of the CMCO, the Conditional Movement Control Order. So we didn't get a chance to go back to our hometown to celebrate the Aidilfitri holiday. But that didn't break our spirits, because last year my first sister Nurliyana was on a family vacation with her in-laws so this year it was her turn to be with us. So we all had the opportunity to be together as a family and had the opportunity to entertain two of our very cute and talkative subordinates. Hehehhehhehe;) I'm the happiest aunt! Yeah</p></center>
			<center><p>So, let's move on to the next page. Hehehhehhe</p></center>
