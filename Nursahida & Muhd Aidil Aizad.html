			<center><p>This one is Nursahida or more affectionately called shida / "adik" / baby.</p></center>
			<center><p>This is shida, she's one of the craziest in our family among all these siblings. Our dad is a serious guy and it's hard to see him smile or laugh but when shida does some craziest things at home, everyone laughs including dad. Shida, a 19-year-old teenager, wants to continue her education to become a soldier but still has no chance. Shida is also a gentle person and definitely annoying her. She is also a very timid person when it comes to meeting people but now that she is working at Popular at the Curve, slowly changes can be seen in his courage to communicate with the public and strangers. Her confidence has become more visible and has improved.</p></center>

			<center><p>This is one is Muhammad Aidil aizad or like being called Aidil / Aizad</p></center>
			<center><p>So, this is aizad. Very fun if we want to talk about aizad. Before this, aizad is being called Baymax because of aizad bodies. Before this aizad is just a fat guy but he is comellll and cute and he is liked by many women because of his elegance. Aizad is the kindest person in this family. Aizad is one the hardest person to get upset and angry. If he was asked to do something, he would do it. Aizad is the easiest person to ask to do any work. Aizad was a personal shopper to our mother because he was the person our mother would look for when she had a kitchen item. At first, aizad was a fat guy but one day something really made him want to lose weight and he was determined to stay lean so he took steps not to eat rice and just eat vegetables by our mom and only drink water. only warm warmth. Cold or sweet water will not always be drunk. Once in a blue moon. In this year, almost 2 years he did not take any rice at all and that has been fruitful and now he has grown thin and has gained the weight he wants. Aizad loves to take our picture, photography is Aizad's passion. All about photography already is on aizad's blood. So if we go anywhere, we already have our photgrapher, editor and such a nice brother on our side.</p></center>
